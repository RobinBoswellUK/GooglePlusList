##Google Plus Post List

#Introduction

Having been posting to Google+ I found there was no easy way to search for my posts containing specific tags.

My idea was for a googleplus listing of posts titles and tags.

This repository is for a simple UI with and populate it, json data to hold the titles and tags, in future it counld be developed to use the g+ API to obtain some of the data dynamically.

The basic task is to create line builder that can generate the HTML for a table or a grid.
Hence the main class is TableGrid.

However there are a couple of helper functions included.

The current project uses this to build the UI, and styles with googlePostsList.css.
